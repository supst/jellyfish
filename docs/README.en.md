An end-to-end production tool for AI-generated short dramas (vertical / micro drama).  
From script input → storyboard extraction → character/scene/prop consistency management → AI video generation → post-production editing → one-click export.

## ✨ Core Value

- **Consistency first**: global seed + unified style + asset reuse, tackling the #1 pain point in AI generation—character/scene drift
- **Industrialized workflow**: from a narrative script to shootable storyboards, then to video clips—an end-to-end closed loop
- **Visual & controllable**: WYSIWYG storyboard editor + fine-grained cinematography controls + real-time preview
- **Asset reuse system**: full lifecycle management of characters/scenes/props/costumes/prompt templates

## 🚀 Key Features

| Module | Core capabilities | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project management | Create projects, unified global style/seed, dashboards, chapter stats | Global seed to reduce drift, enforced style inheritance |
| Chapter production workspace | Script input → smart condense → storyboard extraction → storyboard editing → video generation → preview | Three-column layout, collapsible right panel, batch ops |
| Storyboard fine controls | Shot size/angle/movement/emotion/duration/atmosphere/dialog/music/SFX/hidden shots | Separate prompts for first/last/key frames, multi-version management |
| Advanced generation controls | Reference images across shots, ControlNet (pose/depth), lip-sync, model & duration selection | Controllable motion + lip-sync |
| Asset management | Centralized character/scene/prop/costume management, smart extraction + manual linking + prompt templates | Dual-layer: per-project vs global asset library |
| Prompt template library | Templates for storyboard/character/scene/video/music/SFX/composite prompts | One-click bootstrap for new chapters |
| Post-production editing | Timeline editing, multi-track video/audio, drag-drop asset bin, final export | Edit full episodes directly from AI clips |
| Agent workflows | Custom agents (plot extraction / character extraction / storyboard suggestions), visual orchestration & testing | Node-based workflow editor (Dify-like) |
| Model management | Multi-provider management (OpenAI/Claude/Tongyi/Hunyuan...), model categories (text/image/video) | Per-category defaults, quick connection tests |
| Generated media management | Unified preview for images/videos, tagging, filtering, batch export | Reuse high-quality assets efficiently |
